        The environment and the characters that live within it are the quintessence of ease, <br />
        peace and self-containment. The figures are gods in their daily Olympus.<br />
        It is an ideal world that recalls common gestures, <br />
        a step away from the flow of time and in the same moment, part of contemporary life.<br />
        The drama, or the lack thereof, is played out in simplified, <br />
        almost abstract spaces, geometric backgrounds in which self-aware characters inhabit<br />
        bourgeois interiors or a minimalist wilderness.‚Äù.
